Unity Applicant Test: Unity Scene Test
=====================================

The following test was completed for application as a full-time Unity Developer. 

*ASSUMPTIONS*

* Selected option 1 of 2 is represented in the demo.
* For the demo use, I favored manually dragging transform instances to the inspector to set some key references vs the programmatic alternative of GameObject.Find() and Resources.Load().
* The demo was developed within the time limit. It is complete.
