Unity Applicant Test: Unity Camera Tracking
=====================================

The following test was completed for application as a full-time Unity Developer. 


**INSTRUCTIONS PROVIDED**
* https://github.com/RivelloMultimediaConsulting/CodeSamplesPublic/tree/master/projects/UnityApplicantTests/UnityCameraTracking/Assets/UnityCameraTracking/Documentation/


**ASSUMPTIONS**

* For the demo use, I favored manually dragging transform instances to the inspector to set some key references vs the programmatic alternative of GameObject.Find() and Resources.Load().
* The demo was developed within the time limit. It is complete.
* To limit scope, I favored the “No Manager” approach instead of the more scalable architecture. See various approaches here (http://www.rivellomultimediaconsulting.com/unity3d-game-architectures/)
