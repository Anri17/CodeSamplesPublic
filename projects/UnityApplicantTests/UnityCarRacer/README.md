Unity Applicant Test: Unity Car Racer
=====================================

The following test was completed for application as a full-time Unity Developer. 


**INSTRUCTIONS**

* https://github.com/RivelloMultimediaConsulting/CodeSamplesPublic/tree/master/projects/UnityApplicantTests/UnityCarRacer/Assets/UnityCarRacer/Documentation
* Time Limit: 4 Hours


**ASSUMPTIONS**

* The demo was developed within the time limit. It is complete.
* For the demo use, I favored manually dragging transform instances to the inspector to set some key references vs the programmatic alternative of GameObject.Find() and Resources.Load().
* To limit scope, I favored the “No Manager” approach instead of the more scalable architecture. See various approaches here (http://www.rivellomultimediaconsulting.com/unity3d-game-architectures/)
* Unity’s standard physics employed
* Unity’s standard camera scripting employed
* Data Driven Settings: See in-game GUI
* Data Driven Settings: See Inspector for “Hierarchy->_Players->Car->CarInputComponent”
* Data Driven Settings: (Misc) See Inspector for “Assets/UnityCarRacer/PhysicMaterials/”
* Physics not highly tuned for playability
* Instructions: Use 4 arrow keys to drive. Click buttons to reset. The flags are cosmetic. 


**CODING STANDARDS**

The demo uses my typical coding standards, namespacing, and project folder structure. On teams, I defer to the practices and processes of the group.
