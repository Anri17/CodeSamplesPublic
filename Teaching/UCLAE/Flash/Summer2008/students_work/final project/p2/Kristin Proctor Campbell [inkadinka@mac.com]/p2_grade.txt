OVERVIEW OF ASSIGMENT (NOT SPECIFIC TO YOU)
8 Points total.  One FLA Submitted, outlining every user facing feature and all functional requirements.  It does not require any code or any final graphics. If something is on the stage it’s assumed that the user would see it.  If something is on the pasteboard it’s assumed that it’s a note to you (and me) but not for the user’s eyes. If I find something ‘missing’ that you agree is required for your final project, then this deliverable did not do its job. Full information was given on the syllabus and the written and verbal contents of class including Session #8.
